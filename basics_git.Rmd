```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# 1. Pull, Push and Commits

Git is a powerful tool, at the same time this it allows to control almost all aspects of versioning in our project, it can be very scary. However, as a starting point we need to understand basically three actions: pull, commit and push. The illustration bellow gives a good overview about how those three actions work.

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE,out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "git_pull_comm_push.png"))
```

Let's go to the R scripts to use these commands

# 2. The importance of commits 

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE,out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "git_commit_illustration.png"))
```

# 3. Organizing local repo

We have, at least 3 different types of files:

- R scripts and functions
- data 
- output


So it is reasonable to organize our repository with the following template:

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "directory_org.png"))
```


Now let'ts organize our data

# Naming files

A good rule is: 

**Human + Machine redable**

Example:

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "naming-files-data.png"))
```


# Naming scripts
