Hello!

Thanks for stopping by! This is the supplementary material designed to help the short course *Minimum workflow for computational reproducibility in ecological projects* that will be ministered virtually by me, [Gabriel Nakamura](https://main--gabrielnakamura.netlify.app/), at University of Toronto.
